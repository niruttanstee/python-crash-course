# INHERITANCE
# We don't need to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class we're
# writing is a specialized version of another class we wrote, we can just
# inherit from it.

# It takes on the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class
# is called the PARENT class, and the new class is the CHILD class.

# The child can inherit all or any attributes from the parent class, but it's
#Â also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.

# We must call the parent class using __init__ method in the child class.
# This will initialise any attributes defined in the parent class for the
# child class. 

# Example, let's model an electric car. An electric car is just a specific
# kind of car, so we can base our new ElectricCar class on the Car class
# we wrote earlier.

# The super() function is a special function that allows us to all a method
# from the parent class. It tells for this instance to call the parent's
# init method from Car, which gives ElectricCar instance all the attributes
# defined in that method. The name super comes from a convention of calling
# the parent class a superclass and the child class a subclass.
 
# 1. We can also add attributes and methods to the child class and not affect
# the parent class.

# 2. We can OVERRIDE methods from the parent class if it doesn't fit with the
# child class. We define a method in the child class with the same name of the
# method in the parent class we want to change. Python will disregard the
# parent's class and only pay attention to the method in the child class.
# I.e or electric cars, the class Car has a method called fill_gas_tank()
