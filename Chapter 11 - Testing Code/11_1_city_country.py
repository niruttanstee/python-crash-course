# Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country
# name. ✅

# The function should return a single string of the form City, Country such as
# Santiago, Chile. Store the function in a module called city_functions.py. ✅

# Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function we just wrote. ✅
# Write a method called test_city_country() to verify that calling our function
# with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string. ✅

# Run test_cities.py and make sure the functions passes. ✅
