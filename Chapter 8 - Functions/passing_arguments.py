# Passing arguments.
# A function definition can have multiple parameters, a function call may need
# multiple arguments. You can pass arguments to your functions in a number of
# ways.

# Positional arguments.
#Â Argument passed the same order as they are written in the function
# definition parameters.
# Arguments must match the parameters.

# You can call the function as many times as you want.
# Orders really matter in positional arguments.


# Keyword arguments.
# A name-value pair that you pass to a function. Directly associate the name
# and the value within the argument, to so there is no confusion.
